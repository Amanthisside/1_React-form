# Signup Form

A modern, multi-field signup form built with **React**. This project shows how to handle multiple form inputs using a single `useState` object. It includes live form validation, dynamic dropdowns based on country selection, and a polished result page styled with glassmorphism â€” all without using any external component libraries.
